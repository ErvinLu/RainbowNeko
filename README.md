### CSC767M (Introduction to Computer Graphics) Project

The objective of the project is to be able to demonstrate the things that the students have learned from the computer graphics class. To be able to do so, the students should be able to create 3D objects and render them onto a 3D scene. The main concept of this project is to create a simple endless runner game, similar to "Sonic the Hedgehog: Classic",  wherein the main objective of the game is to collect "coins" and avoid obstacles. The game was created using the Three.js, OrbitControls.js, and TweenMax.js libraries and was inspired by the <a href="https://bit.ly/2DXHjaw">tutorial</a> posted by Karim Maaloul.
